// AUTOCON Server "Virus" Primary Execution File
Â© IAN Studios 2021, All rights unreserved.

This code is free. take it.

For use in AUTOCON pacakge. Edits to file may cause corruption or large errors.

IDK why i wrote all of that

How the code works:

Step 1: Scan all servers at current depth (TODO: Remove owned server from list for convinence)
Step 2: Test every server to see if it is viable for attack
Step 2.1: If server can be nuked, or made viable for attack, run nuke or hack system
Step 3: Upload all files requried for efficient attack
Step 4: Run scripts
Step 5: ???
Step 6: Profit

The goal of true efficiency can be made by simply lowering the security of the server- Once low enough,
Hacking and weakening will take less and less.

Theoretically.
